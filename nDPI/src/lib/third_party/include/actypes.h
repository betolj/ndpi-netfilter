/* AC_ALPHABET_t:
 * defines the alphabet type.
 * Actually defining AC_ALPHABET_t as a char will work, but sometimes we deal
 * with streams of other (bigger) types e.g. integers, specific enum, objects.
 * Although they consists of string of bytes (chars), but using their specific
 * types for AC_ALPHABET_t will lead to a better performance. so instead of
 * dealing with strings of chars, we assume dealing with strings of
 * AC_ALPHABET_t and leave it optional for other developers to define their
 * own alphabets.
 **/
typedef char AC_ALPHABET_t;

/* AC_REP_t:
 * Provides a more readable representative for a pattern.
 * because patterns themselves are not always suitable for displaying
 * (e.g. for hex patterns), we offer this type to improve intelligibility
 * of output. furthermore, sometimes it is useful, for example while
 * retrieving patterns from a database, to maintain their identifiers in the
 * automata for further reference. we provisioned two possible types as a
 * union for this purpose. you can add your desired type in it.
 **/
typedef union {

/* AC_PATTERN_t:
 * This is the pattern type that must be fed into AC automata.
 * the 'astring' field is not null-terminated, due to it can contain zero
 * value bytes. the 'length' field determines the number of AC_ALPHABET_t it
 * carries. the 'representative' field is described in AC_REP_t. despite
 * 'astring', 'representative' can have duplicate values for different given
 * AC_PATTERN_t. it is an optional field and you can just fill it with 0.
 * CAUTION:
 * Not always the 'astring' points to the correct position in memory.
 * it is the responsibility of your program to maintain a permanent allocation
 * for astring field of the added pattern to automata.

 * The input text type that is fed to ac_automata_search() to be searched.
 * it is similar to AC_PATTERN_t. actually we could use AC_PATTERN_t as input
 * text, but for the purpose of being more readable, we defined this new type.

/* AC_MATCH_t:
 * Provides the structure for reporting a match event.
 * a match event occurs when the automata reaches a final node. any final
 * node can match one or more pattern at a position in a text. the
 * 'patterns' field holds these matched patterns. obviously these
 * matched patterns have same end-position in the text. there is a relationship
 * between matched patterns: the shorter one is a factor (tail) of the longer
 * one. the 'position' maintains the end position of matched patterns. the
 * start position of patterns could be found by knowing their 'length' in
 * AC_PATTERN_t. e.g. suppose "recent" and "cent" are matched at
 * position 40 in the text, then the start position of them are 34 and 36
 * respectively. finally the field 'match_num' maintains the number of
 * matched patterns.

/* MATCH_CALBACK_t:
 * This is the call-back function type that must be given to automata at
 * initialization to report match occurrence to the caller.
 * at a match event, the automata will reach you using this function and sends
 * you a pointer to AC_MATCH_t. using that pointer you can handle
 * matches. you can send parameters to the call-back function when you call
 * ac_automata_search(). at call-back, the automata will sent you those
 * parameters as the second parameter (void *) of MATCH_CALBACK_t. inside
 * the call-back function you can cast it to whatever you want.
 * If you return 0 from MATCH_CALBACK_t function to the automata, it will
 * continue searching, otherwise it will return from ac_automata_search()
 * to your calling function.
